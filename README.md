# üêç Python, Machine Learning & Statistics Q&A Practice

This repository contains my **practice notes and worked-out questions** on:
- ‚úÖ Python programming fundamentals  
- ‚úÖ Machine Learning concepts and implementations  
- ‚úÖ Statistics & Probability for data science  

It is designed as a **study resource** for interviews, exams, and revision.
